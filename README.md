# KMM-Arch-PetSearch


**PetSearch** is an effort to explore and showcase the Kotlin-Multiplatform possibilities.
In this project, I have tried to implement the best practices of mobile application development that I have learned so far.
With that said, just like other humans, I make mistakes (sometimes, really stupid). By no means, this project should be seen as a standard template for KMM development.

## Project Setup

### PetFinder Api
- Generate [PetFinder](https://www.petfinder.com) ApiKey and Secret from [here](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/).
- Create `apikey.properties` in `root` dir
- Add the following in properties file
    ```
    API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
    API_SECRET=<YOUR_API_SECRET>
    ```
- Run `./gradlew generateBuildKonfig`


### Android
- Java 11
- You require [Android Studio Chipmunk](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases)
- Install Kmm Plugin. Checkout [this setup guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kmm-setup.html).
- Create `keystore.properties` in `root` dir and add the following lines in the file. Values can be anything as long as you're not generating a signed APK
    ```
    STORE_FILE=<YOUR_STORE_FILE>
    STORE_PASSWORD=<YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD>
    KEY_ALIAS=<YOUR_KEY_ALIAS>
    KEY_PASSWORD=<YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD>
    ```
